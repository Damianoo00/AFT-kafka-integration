  description: >
    Print Service is a minimal utility API that accepts arbitrary JSON payloads
    and logs them for inspection or debugging.

    It does not persist or forward the received data.
    Its primary purpose is to allow Kafka Reader or Writer services
    to send test payloads and observe their structure.

      summary: Log arbitrary JSON payload
      description: >
        Accepts any JSON payload and logs it to stdout / application logs.
        
        Useful as a debug endpoint to inspect what other services send.
        The service returns a static acknowledgment and does not validate
        nor transform the input payload.
