  version: 1.0.0
  description: >
    Kafka Writer is a lightweight REST service responsible for producing
    messages to Kafka topics.
    
    It exposes HTTP endpoints that allow:
      - writing messages to existing Kafka topics
      - creating Kafka topics on demand
    
    The service validates topic existence before producing messages
    and uses a short-lived in-memory cache to reduce metadata calls.

      summary: Write message to Kafka topic
      description: >
        Produces a single message to an existing Kafka topic.
        
        The service verifies that the topic exists before sending
        the message. Messages are sent synchronously
        (producer.flush is called before returning).

      description: >
        Creates a new Kafka topic with a single partition
        and replication factor equal to one.
        
        If the topic already exists, the request is treated as successful
        and no error is returned.
